# Product Breakfast
Each month, a group of the brightest product minds gathers over coffee and pastries to chat about the world of product management. For attendees, it’s not only a welcomed break from the monotonous beer-and-pizza-and-a-panel-discussion meetups, it's an invaluable resource for ideas, advice and mentorship.

Our community has spent countless hours dissecting product management tactics, strategies, tools, and philosophies to help our community members: the PMs doing the work and the product-driven companies who employ them.
